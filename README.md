# Hangman-Game
This is a game developed as the final project for the Intermediate Python Course from Platzi.

RULES FOR THE PROJECT:
1.-Incorporate comprehensions, error management and file handling.
2.-Utilize the file "data.txt" as the database and read it in order to get the words for the game.
3.-Improve the game from what was shown in the course.

HOW WILL I IMPROVE THE GAME?:
1.-A file called "english-data.txt" was created for people who find the repository in GitHub.
2.- A points system will be integrated into the game.
3.-The hangman will appear with every failed attempt.
4.-A friendly interface will be developed.
